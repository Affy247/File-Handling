# File Handling in Python

This repository contains my Week 4 Python classwork and assignment.

## Contents
- oPenfile.py : Practice file from class (open, read, write, append, error handling).  
- assignment.py : Assignment program that:
  - Reads input.txt`
  - Counts words
  - Converts text to uppercase
  - Writes results to `output.txt`
-challenges.py : writes a file by adding texts,  processes its content, and writes the results to a new file.

## How to Run
1. Make sure `input.txt` has at least 5 lines of text.  
2. Run the program:  
   ```bash
   python assignment.py
